# Numerical Methods Analysis

This repository provides a comparative study analysis on the numerical methods Newton Rhapson (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) and Regula falsi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regula_falsi). The analysis includes full code implementation (100% mine) for both methods and functions for visualizations of different parameters and generation of reports. The reports include comparisons between solutions, time durations, number of iterations and convergence for both methods tested on couple of different error rate values and convergence criterion methods for a single function. The methods were tested on numerous functions using numerous interval initializations to test each of the method's convergence criterions. Multiple reports can be generated by tweaking these parameters and changing the testing function. The visualizations folder provides plots of the function being solved in the given interval, scatterplots of deltas (distances from the generated solutions in a given iteration vs the real analytical solution), number of iterations for each method, time duration of the method and variance of the generated solutions. As an initial note from all the generated outputs, reports and visualizations, Regula falsi seems much more stable due to the fact that it doesn't impose any restrictions on the functions like Newton Rhapson but is slightly slower. If the user can find the proper interval and apply the Newton Rhapson method on a proper function which satisfies the condition, this method is much more superior in comparison.
