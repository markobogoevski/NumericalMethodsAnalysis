# Numerical Methods Analysis

This repo provides comparative study analysis on the numerical methods: Newton Rhapson (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) and Regula falsi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regula_falsi). The analysis includes full code implementation (100% mine) for both methods and functions for visualizations and generation of reports. The reports include comparisons between solution, time durations, number of iterations and convergence for both methods tested on couple of different error rate values and convergence criterion methods for a single function. Multiple reports can be generated by tweaking these parameters and changing the testing function. Note: If given a function to Newton Rhapson which doesn't satisfy the convergence criterions the current code won't stop running (still in initial phase).
